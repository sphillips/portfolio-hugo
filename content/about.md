## A little bit about myself...

My career began about a decade ago in New York at a digital strategy & branding agency where I built websites and managed servers for our clients, in the days when Wordpress and jQuery dominated the web dev landscape and Rails was just starting to catch on.

Five years later, I relocated to Berlin where I was hired the head the engineering team at CareerFoundry, a young ed-tech startup selling courses in web dev and UX design.

Currently I'm working as a freelance remote developer and Berlin is my home base.

Drop me a line on Xing or LinkedIn if you'd like to have a chat.
